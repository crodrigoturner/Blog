My name is Carlos Rodrigo Turner, I live in Madrid with my wife Mar.

This is my blog, it's about sharing things that I find important and explaining why I think they're important.

I work at Técnica y Avance.

I once read the following quote that stuck with me and has now become my goal:
<blockquote>The purpose of life is right in front of us: It is to create a reality we want to inhabit — to reach towards the better end of our conscious experience.</blockquote>
