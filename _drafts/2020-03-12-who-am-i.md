excerpt: We should get to know ourselves.

I've come to very slowly realize that I don't know myself as good as I should, I keep moving forward without a clear goal and I feel I'm not the only one. 

We move through life moving from one thing to another without a clear path, like a pinball bouncing around. 

I've come up with a list of questions that should help me to know myself better, of course I am not a static being, I evolve, I change, I improve or get worse... this is a list I/we should revise frequently.

1. Who  am I?
2. What makes me happy?
3. Who makes me happy?
4. What makes me sad?
5. Who makes me sad?
6. What do I like?
7. What am I good at?
8. What am I bad at?
9. What do I want from life?
10. What can I give back?
11. What is my purpose?
12. What are you deeply passionate about?
13. What are you are genetically encoded for — what activities do you feel just “made to do”?
